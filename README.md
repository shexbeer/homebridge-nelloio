# homebridge-nelloio


Example config.json:

```
    "accessories": [
        {
            "accessory": "Nelloio",
            "name": "Haust√ºr",
            "username":"<INSERT YOUR ACCOUNT MAIL ADRESS>",
            "password":"<INSERT YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD>"
        } 
    ]

```

You will need to create a user (further called homebridge user) inside nello app and give him permanent access.
Then logout your user from nello app and request a new password for homebridge user.
You'll receive a mail with a temporary password by mail.
With this password login homebridge user into app.

--> your homebridge nello user is setup, you can login you own user into your nello app again
--> enter the homebridge nello user credentials into your config.json
--> first switch on will do a login and persist session credential
--> further switches will trigger a nello open

## limitations

* because there is no public api, we use a undocumented "private" api
* password are stored plaintext on raspberry(!) to a normal user of nello
* it just uses switch characterics for now (this needs to be changed to a fake lock device)
* it just supports one location
* no relogin when session fails

## roapmap

planned for version 0.2:
* change characteristics to a fake lock
